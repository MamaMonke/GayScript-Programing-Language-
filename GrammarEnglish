The script is also saved with the scene.  
The list of scripts will appear in the inspector.

Example player script:
GameScript  # This is a required keyword in GayScript that defines the script as a game script, not an engine script.
Working Hierarchy.Player  # Finds the player in the hierarchy and interacts with it in code. “Working” means we’re searching by path.
{  # Block with actions
# This is a comment
Player.Speed = 10  # Goes to Player, selects Speed, and sets the speed value to 10
Player.JumpForce = 10  # Goes to Player, selects JumpForce, and sets the jump force to 10
}  # End of actions (and the end of the script)

Such scripts only work inside the engine and ONLY in Play Mode.
Below you can find GayScript syntax and commands for other objects.

For blocks:
GameScript
Working Hierarchy.Green_Cube
{
Block.Scale = 1, 1, 1
Block.Position = 0, 5, 0
Block.Rotation = 0, 45, 0
Block.Color = 0, 255, 0
}

For individual inspector fields (like in Unity — fields you can edit directly in the engine, shown here with a player example):
GameScript
Working Hierarchy.Player
{
line "Player Speed"  # A label that appears in the inspector before the Speed field
line.ask Player.Speed  # The editor checks what is entered in the inspector field and applies that number to Player.Speed
Player.Speed = [line]  # Takes the value from the line field and assigns it to Player.Speed
}

Example with blocks:
GameScript
Working Hierarchy.Green_Cube
{
# line is a field in the inspector
line "Block Scale"
line "Block Rotation"
# line.ask makes the editor check the values from the fields
line.ask Block.Scale  # The editor checks what is entered in the inspector and applies it to Block.Scale
line.ask Block.Rotation  # Same but for Block.Rotation
# After the editor checks the values, we assign them
Block.Scale = [line]  # Takes the value from the line and assigns it to Block.Scale
Block.Rotation = [line]  # Takes the value from the line and assigns it to Block.Rotation
}

GameScript
Working Hierarchy.Green_Cube
{
line "Block Color"
line.ask Block.Color
Block.Color = [line]

line "Block Position"
line.ask Block.Position
Block.Position = [line]
}

Example with camera rotation speed:
GameScript
Working Hierarchy.Player
{
line "Camera Rotation Speed"  # Label shown in the inspector before CameraRotationSpeed
line.ask Player.CameraRotationSpeed  # Editor checks the value from the field and applies it to the camera rotation speed
Player.SpinSpeed = [line]  # Assigns the value from the line field to camera spin speed
}

Example with if/else:
GameScript
# Added support for multiple "Working" objects
Working Hierarchy.Player  # Using the Player
Working Hierarchy.Green_Cube  # Using the green cube
{
# Added "using" to mark which objects are used
using Player:  # Declares that Player is being used
using Green_Cube:  # Declares that Green_Cube is being used
Block.Color = 255, 255, 255  # Default block color = white
if Player.Colision == Green_Cube  # If the player collides with the green cube
    Block.Color = 255, 0, 0  # The block turns red
else  # Otherwise
    Block.Color = 255, 255, 255  # The block stays white
}

Example disabling collision:
GameScript
Working Hierarchy.Green_Cube
{
Block.Colision = false  # Disables collision on the block
}

Example disabling player collision:
GameScript
Working Hierarchy.Player
{
Player.Colision = false  # Disables player collision, causing the player to fall endlessly (pretty useless)
}
